    <h1> Homework 2-- Izze Steinke</h1>
    <h2>Mapping a Walk to Ben and Jerry's</h2>
    <h3>This is a map showing a route I made from my house to the closest ice cream shop-- Ben and Jerry's! It also shows nearby neighborhood parks (a vector layer I downloaded from the internet), and the destination park (my favorite one-- Hargraves Community Park!). </h3>

    <h4>Below is the link to the GitHub folder, and the link to where the Vector Data can be found! I downloaded it from the Town of Chapel Hill website, and more maps were included as part of the layer than were included in the actual map, but I figured zooming out to include them would be a little counterintuitive for ease of reading.</h4>
